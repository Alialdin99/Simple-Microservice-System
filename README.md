# Simple-Microservice-System
This microservices system is designed for efficient and reliable communication between services. It includes two local services that interact through RabbitMQ, which acts as the message broker. Both RabbitMQ and MongoDB are containerized using Docker, providing a consistent and isolated environment for messaging and data storage.
